# StageNGo

## About

Contraction of Â«Â stageÂ Â» (Â«Â internshipÂ Â» in French), Â«Â andÂ Â» & Â«Â GoÂ Â», Stageâ€™Nâ€™Go have been the fruit of a four people group work during my first year of DiPhe at the Gustave Eiffel University. The aim of the project was to provide a tangible solution to a relevant problematic linked to our studies and educational journey. We then chose the internship problematic, which is relevant in a such case because many students lack at finding an internship for their studies for various reasons. We then wished to bring back together every single side of the global topic that is internship on one website.

On this platform, final render of the exercise, both students and companies can interact. Companies upload internship offers and describe the studentâ€™s profile that would fit the best their needs, and students can then postulate for these offers.

The website have been realized using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP & MySQL technologies.
